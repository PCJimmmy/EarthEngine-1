# EarthEngine
This is a set of tutorials using the Earth Engine Python and JavaScript API. It is presently still being updated and modified. 
For anyone interested in using these tutorials, feel free to do so. Many of these have been prepared using several references available 
at the Earth Engine forum, the example codes on the Earth Engine page as well as examples by N Clinton, N Gorelick and G Dochyts. 
Additional referencing and improvements will be undertaken shortly.
